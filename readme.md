# Predicting Deep Learning Task Failure in Large-Scale Computing Clusters

This repository contains code and data related to our experiments using the [Alibaba Cluster Trace Dataset (GPU Trace 2020)](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/blob/master/cluster-trace-gpu-v2020).

>Qizhen Weng, Wencong Xiao, Yinghao Yu, Wei Wang, Cheng Wang, Jian He, Yong Li, Liping Zhang, Wei Lin, and Yu Ding. 2022. MLaaS in the Wild: Workload Analysis and Scheduling in Large-Scale Heterogeneous GPU Clusters. In *Proceedings of the 19th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 22)*, 2022.


## Overview

- **Dataset and utils.py**: The dataset and the `utils.py` file included in this repository are derived from the Alibaba Cluster Trace Dataset, specifically from their GPU trace for 2020. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/blob/master/cluster-trace-gpu-v2020).

- **Code Organization**: 
  - **Jupyter Notebooks**: The Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository contain all the code necessary to reproduce the experiments. However, please note that The code in the project outside the Jupyter notebooks is the version use in the experiments.
  - **Python Files**: The actual implementation of the experiments is located in separate `*.py` files.
